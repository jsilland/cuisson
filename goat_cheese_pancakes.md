Ingredients
-----------

Makes 14 pancakes

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 7 teaspoons baking powder
- 4 teaspoons salt
- 1 quart milk
- 2 eggs
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 1 half-potato
- 2 oz. bulk spinach
- 2 oz. walnuts
- 6 oz. goat cheese
- 1 dry pint cherry tomatoes
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 tbsp. olive oil
- Herbes de Provence

Directions
----------

Cut all the tomatoes in eighth. In a small saucepan over high heat, put a bit of olive oil, a pinch of salt and the herbes de Provence. When hot, throw in the tomatoes and cook under medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring every minute or so. Reserve in a bowl. Stem the spinach leaves and cut in rough pieces, approximately 3/8" to 5/8", then reserve in a bowl. Crush the walnuts by hands and reserve. Work the goat cheese in small crumbles and reserve.

In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder and salt together. Melt the butter slowly under low heat. Make a well and pour in the eggs, butter and milk. Mix __by hand__ until the batter is smooth â€” using an electric whisk incorporates air, which renders the batter thicker than desired.

Heat a small frying pan under medium heat for at least 3 minutes: it's important that the heat is uniform. Pour a bit of olive oil in a bowl and use a potato cut in half and fork to apply the oil over the pan. Pour one laddle (about 1/4 cup) of batter into the pan, then incorporate the tomatoess, walnuts. Sprinkle with the goat cheese and finally the spinach. Try to cover the cheese with the spinach, leaves so that they are not directly exposed to the surface of the pan once the pancake is flipped. Keep over heat for another minute once flipped.
