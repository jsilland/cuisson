Ingredients
-----------

Serves 2

2 duck legs
2 carrots
garlic, 3 cloves
fennel
porcini mushrooms
rosemary
olive oil
chianti wine
1 big can of peeled tomatoes (14 oz.)
fresh papardelle
italian parsley

Directions
----------

In a pan, put the olive oil and bring to high heat, then place the two legs in the pan. After five minutes, turn the legs to cook the other side for five more minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add half a glass of water and cover. Leave the legs to cook slowly.

Cut the fennel into rings. Save a few rings and one mushroom for later. Slice the remaining mushrooms and mince the carrots, garlic and a bit of the fennel â€” not too much.

In a dutch oven, cook the minced ingredients and the rosemary into olive oil on high heat for a few minutes. Pour a bit of the wine and reduce the heat for another five minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Pour the peeled tomatoes in the dutch oven and add water, about half of the tomato can. Let the ragu evaporate for two hours.

Thirty minutes before the ragu is done, remove the skin from the duck legs and cut the meat off the bones. Retain as little fat as possible. Reduce the meat into small bits and integrate into the ragu.

Ten minutes before the ragu is done, bring two quarts of water to a boil. Slice the remaining porcini mushroom. In a frying pan, put a bit of olive oil under high heat, then brown the fennel rings and the mushroom slices in oil.

 Add salt and olive oil salt to the water. Cook the fresh papardelle into the water for three minutes. Serve with the ragu on top of the pasta. Top each serving with two or three browned mushroom slices, the fried fennel rings and minced parsley.
