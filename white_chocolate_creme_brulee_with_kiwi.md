Ingredients
-----------

Serves 6

- 1 quart crême fraiche
- 1 cup sugar
- 6 egg yolks
- 2 quarts hot water
- 1/2 lb. white chocolate
- 3 kiwis

Directions
----------

Preheat the oven to 325℉.

In a medium saucepan, heat the crême and the chocolate under medium heat and bring to a boil. Make sure the chocolate is fully melted into the crême. Remove and let rest for 15 minutes.

Cut two kiwis in half then remove the skin using a spoon and cut into quarters. Cut each quarter in slices 2mm thick and reserve in a bowl.

In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks and the sugar until mix is consistent. Add the cream to the bowl a little at a time, stirring as you pour it. Pour the liquid into a half-dozen ramequins and evenly integrate the pieces of kiwi into the ramequins, first halfway through and again at the end.

Set the ramequins into a large cake pan and pour the hot water around them. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and at most 3 days.

At least 30 minutes before serving, remove the ramequins from the fridge. Cut the last kiwi in half, remove the skin, then cut 6 slices, 2mm each. Sprinkle sugar on top of the ramequins, then torch lightly until surface is brown. Let set for another 5 minutes, then add one kiwi slice on top of each ramequin.
