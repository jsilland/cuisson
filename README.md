Recipes
=======

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site in which I publish the recipes I like. The master branch is empty, please head t the [gh-pages](https://github.com/jsilland/recipes/tree/gh-pages) branch for the source content, or to the site's [homepage](http://jsilland.github.io/recipes) to start cooking.
