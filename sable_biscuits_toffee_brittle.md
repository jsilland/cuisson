title: Sablé biscuits toffee brittle
description: "While not exactly being the easiest to execute, this recipe manages to deliver a punch and will be appreciated by anyone having the slightest sweet tooth. The richness and crumbly texture of the sablé dough provides a perfect base for the layers of toffee and chocolate on top of which the hazelnuts come and add color and crunch."

Ingredients
-----------

Makes 25~30 pieces

Sablé

- 250 grams all-purpose flour
- 80 grams sugar
- 125 grams soft butter (1 stick), cut into 4 cubes
- 1 egg
- Fleur de sel

Toffee

- 125 grams butter (1 stick)
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
- Crushed hazelnuts

Directions
----------

In a large bowl, use a wooden spoon to mix the egg, a pinch of fleur de sel and the sugar. Add the cubes of butter, then the flour, and mix energetically using your hands. Take the mix out of the bowl, shape into a sphere and wrap in cellophane, refrigerate for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 375℉ (175 ℃). Take the sable dough out of the fridge, soften and flatten with your hands, then spread using a rolling pin. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into diamond or square shapes. Lay parchment paper on a cookie sheet. Arrange the pieces in a packed structure, so that cookies are about ¼" apart. Put in oven for about 10 minutes, until the biscuits' edges become slightly brown.

In a small saucepan, over medium-high heat, melt the butter and then add the sugar. Stir often while bringing the mixture to a boil, then bring the temperature down as the toffee becomes brown. Pour the toffee mixture directly from the saucepan onto each biscuit, spread evenly using a spatula if needed.

Put back in the oven for 5 minutes, this should make the toffee bubble and spread it over the whole surface of the sheet. Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of the hot toffee, let rest for 1 minute, then spread evenly using a spatula. Sprinkle the crushed hazelnuts while the chocolate is still sticky. Refrigerate for 30 minutes in the fridge, then 30 minutes in the freezer.

Using a sharp instrument, break the surface by applying pressure on the gaps between the biscuits. Break into pieces roughly the size of one biscuit. Smooth out the sharp edges, then store in a fridge for up to two weeks.
