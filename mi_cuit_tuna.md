title: Sesame crusted mi-cuit tuna, cucumber spaghetti and grilled Cayenne pineapple
description: "Combining ingredients that are not commonly seen together, this recipe also tries to prepare each of them in a novel fashion. The Cayenne pepper adds a spicy layer to the pineapple, the warm cucumber spaghetti are quite a surprise and the mi-cuit tuna packs the punch of both a seared steak and sashimi. Truly an original, this recipe is a festive mix of textures, colors and tastes."

Ingredients
-----------

Serves 2

- 1 Large tuna steak (~ 1lb)
- 1 Pineapple
- 1 Cucumber
- Sesame seeds (white and black)
- Cayenne pepper
- Olive oil, grapeseed oil
- Salt, pepper

Directions
----------

Take the tuna out of the fridge and let rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 150℃ (300℉).

Wash the cucumber and peel it partially lengthwise. Using a mandoline, slice the cucumber at a shallow angle into pieces about 3 to 4 millimeters thick. Cut each slice lengthwise to form filaments about 2 or 3 millimeters wide. Reserve in a bowl.

</ul>

Cut the pineapple in slices about 1 centimeter thick. Using round cookie cutters, remove the core and skin off of each slice.

Mix the black and white sesame seeds and spread them on a cutting board, roughly in the shape of the tuna steak. Set the raw steak on top of the seeds and apply some pressure on top of the steak to make the seeds stick. Clean the sides of the steak with the dull side of a knife.

In a cast iron grill pan, bring two tablespoons of olive oil to its smoking point. While waiting, sprinkle a very small amount of Cayenne pepper onto the pineapple slices. Set the slices onto the grill and cook each side for 3 to 4 minutes under medium to high heat. Once the slices show nice brown marks, put the grilling pan into the oven.

 Melt butter in a medium saucepan under medium heat. Once melted, throw in the cucumber spaghetti, then salt and pepper to taste. Sauté the spaghetti in the saucepan under low to medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes.

In a frying pan under high heat, put two tablespoons of grapeseed oil and let it reach it smoking point. Set the tuna steak in the pan, sesame seeds face down, and watch the sides of the steak to gauge the progress of the cooking. The browned part of the fish should make between a third and half of the total height.

On a cutting board, slice the tuna into pieces 6 to 7 millimeters thick (¼ to ⅓ inches). Serve along with the spaghetti and two slices of pineapple in each plate.
